🎯 YES! You are 100% CORRECT!
Sending user IDs to the frontend is unnecessary and creates a security risk. The JWT token already contains all the information needed for authentication and user identification.

🔒 Why Not Send User ID to Frontend?
Security Risks:
Enumeration Attacks: Attackers can guess/iterate through user IDs
Direct Object Reference (IDOR): Users might try to access other users' data by changing IDs
Information Disclosure: Reveals database structure (MongoDB ObjectIDs are predictable)
Unnecessary Data Exposure: Frontend doesn't need IDs for authentication
What Frontend Actually Needs:
✅ JWT Token (for authentication)
✅ User Display Info (name, email, role for UI only)
❌ NOT the user ID (backend extracts it from token)
