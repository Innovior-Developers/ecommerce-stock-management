Summary of Security Recommendations
✅ DO:
Use public UUIDs instead of MongoDB ObjectIds
Mask sensitive data (email, phone) in admin responses
Audit all admin actions with logging
Use API Resources to transform data before sending
Store only JWT token in localStorage
Validate token on backend for every request
Use HTTPS in production
Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
❌ DON'T:
Don't expose MongoDB _id to frontend
Don't send full user object in login response
Don't store user data in localStorage
Don't expose customer PII unnecessarily
Don't trust frontend - always validate on backend
Don't use predictable IDs for resources
