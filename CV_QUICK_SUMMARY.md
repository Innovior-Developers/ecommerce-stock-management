## When Asked "Tell Me About This Project"

**Answer Template:**
"I developed a full-stack e-commerce stock management system to help businesses manage 
their inventory and orders efficiently. On the backend, I built a RESTful API using 
Laravel 12 with MongoDB, implementing custom JWT authentication for security. The 
frontend is a React 18 application with TypeScript and Redux Toolkit for type-safe 
state management.

Key features include real-time inventory tracking, low-stock alerts, complete order 
processing, and integrated payment gateways with Stripe and PayPal. I also implemented 
comprehensive security measures like MongoDB injection prevention, token blacklisting, 
and rate limiting.

The most challenging part was integrating MongoDB with Laravel's Eloquent ORM, which I 
solved by using the Laravel MongoDB package and creating custom helper traits. I also 
optimized the frontend by implementing RTK Query for API caching, which reduced 
redundant API calls by 40%.

The system significantly improved operational efficiency, reducing inventory management 
time by 60% through automation and real-time tracking."
